title: Blog Post 2 - Creating a WebApp
---

In this blog post, I will go over the process of creating a simple webapp that takes in user messages

## app.py

This file contains the functions that are used to display the html pages and process the messages.

### main

```python
#Show base page with links to submit and view
@app.route("/")
def main():
    return render_template("basic.html")
```

This function will call render_template on basic.html, which just contains the links to submit and view messages.

### get_message_db

```python
#Function retrieves or creates the connection
def get_message_db():
    #Checks if message_db exists in g
    try:
        g.message_db

    #If it doesn't, it creates it
    except AttributeError:
        g.message_db = sqlite3.connect("messages_db.sqlite")
        cursor = g.message_db.cursor()

        #Also creates a messages table, if needed
        cmd = """
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages (
            id int,
            handle varchar(50),
            message varchar(200))
            """
        cursor.execute(cmd)

    #Returns that connection
    return g.message_db
```

The purpose of this function is to retrieve or create a SQL connection to the database where we are storing the messages. If the connection is already open, we don't want to recreate it, because that could interupt the process before things are saved. We do this with try and except, so we try to call g.message_db and if that raises an error, we open the connection and create the messages table if it doesn't exist. Lastly, we return g.message_db as either way it now exists.

### insert_message

```python
#Function inserts the message into the table
def insert_message(request):
    #Get inputs from form
    message = request.form['message']
    handle = request.form['handle']

    #Use function to get cursor
    cursor = get_message_db().cursor()

    #Count the number of rows in messages
    cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM messages")
    nrows = cursor.fetchall()[0][0]

    #Add row for new message
    cmd = "INSERT INTO messages VALUES (" + str(nrows + 1)
    cmd += ", \"" + handle + "\", \"" + message + "\")"
    cursor.execute(cmd)
    get_message_db().commit() #Commit changes so they save
    get_message_db().close() #Always close connection when done
```

This function will add a row for the message from the form to the messages table. It gets the message and handle inputs from the request argument, and then counts the rows to create an id. To do SQL operations on the table, we call get_message_db() to retrieve the connection and make a cursor. We use INSERT INTO and the cursor to add the row, commiting the change before closing the connection so it saves.

### submit

```python
#Establish submit page
@app.route("/submit", methods=['POST', 'GET'])
def submit():
    if request.method == 'GET' :
        return render_template("submit.html")
    else:
        insert_message(request)
        return render_template("submit.html", done = True)
```

This function is responsible for displaying the submit.html page. If the page is getting information, meaning the user hasn't inputted anything, we will simply call render_template(). But if the request method is 'POST' a message has been submitted, so we will call insert_message with the request and add an argument to render_template() so an additional message is displayed.

### random_messages

```python
#Function returns a list of rows of messages from the table
def random_messages(n):
    #Use function to get cursor
    cursor = get_message_db().cursor()

    #Extract n random rows
    cmd = "SELECT * FROM messages ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT "+ str(n) + ";"
    cursor.execute(cmd)
    rows = cursor.fetchall()
    get_message_db().close() #Always close connection when done

    return rows
```

This function will return n randomly selected rows of messages. We use the same process as before to get the cursor, execute the SELECT command and finally return the results.

### view

```python
#Establish view page
@app.route("/view")
def view():
    rows = random_messages(6)
    return render_template('view.html', rows = rows)
```

This function, which is called when the view page is loaded, will render the view.html template with the arguments rows as the returned value of random_messages with 6 messages.

## HTML templates

This webapp contains three templates:

- basic.html - base page that just has links and accepts arguments the header and content
- submit.html - extends basic.html with form for submitting a message
- view.html - extends basic.html and displays the messages

### submit.html

![submit.png](/images/submit.png)

This file extends basic.html, so it has a header block, containing the title within header tags, and a content block, containing the form. This form has a fieldset containing it so it looks separate from the rest of the page. There is a big text area with a label for message, a text input with a lable for the handle, and a submit button at the bottom. Then if the template it rendered with done=True, "Message received!" will be displayed below the form.

## Results
