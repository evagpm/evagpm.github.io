## 1 Create a Database

We are going to create a database with three tables to efficiently access information.

To do this, we will need the following imports.


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import sqlite3
```

### Temperatures table

The temperatures dataset includes the temperatures for each month of a year for thousands of stations. There is separate file for each decade worth of years, so we add that decade to the url. Let's look at the data table for the most recent decade.


```python
interval = "2011-2020"
temps_url = f"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/noaa-ghcn/decades/{interval}.csv"
temps_recent = pd.read_csv(temps_url)
temps_recent.head()
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {

    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



The way this data is set up is not tidy, since there are 12 temperatures values in each observation. To make it tidy, we want to have one row for each month. The temperature values are also in hundreths of a degree, so we want to divide them by degree. Let's make a function to do this.


```python
def prep_temp_df(df):
    """
    This function tidys and cleans the data.
    It makes each observation be the temperature for a station, year, and month
    and neatens the new columns of month and temp
    
    Input: df - a dataframe of temperatures
    
    Outputs a restructured dataframe of the temperatures
    """
    #We want to keep ID and Year as columns in the transformed table
    df = df.set_index(keys=["ID", "Year"])
    
    #Convert table
    df = df.stack()
    df = df.reset_index()
    
    #Make the new columns for Month and Temp look nice
    df = df.rename(columns = {"level_2"  : "Month" , 0 : "Temp"})
    df["Month"] = df["Month"].str[5:].astype(int)
    df["Temp"]  = df["Temp"] / 100
    return(df)
```

So now it looks like this.


```python
prep_temp_df(temps_recent).head()
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>ID</th>
      <th>Year</th>
      <th>Month</th>
      <th>Temp</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>ACW00011604</td>
      <td>2011</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>-0.83</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>ACW00011604</td>
      <td>2011</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>-1.32</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>ACW00011604</td>
      <td>2011</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>2.78</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>ACW00011604</td>
      <td>2011</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>10.40</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>ACW00011604</td>
      <td>2011</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>12.13</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



Now we'll create the database.


```python
conn = sqlite3.connect("climate.db")
```

We want to add the data, one decade file at a time. So for each decade, we will read in data from the url, prepare it, and add it to the temperatures table.


```python
#List with the start of each decade
decades = np.arange(1901, 2021, 10)

for start in decades:
    interval = str(start) + "-" + str(start+9)
    temps_url = f"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/noaa-ghcn/decades/{interval}.csv"
    
    #Create iterator to reach in chunk
    df_iter = pd.read_csv(temps_url, chunksize = 100000)
    
    #Iterate through the file, adding chunks
    for df in df_iter:
        cleaned = prep_temp_df(df)
        cleaned.to_sql("temperatures", conn, if_exists = "append", index = False)
```

### Stations table

We will get our next table from its url.


```python
stations_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/noaa-ghcn/station-metadata.csv"
stations = pd.read_csv(stations_url)
stations.head(3)
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>ID</th>
      <th>LATITUDE</th>
      <th>LONGITUDE</th>
      <th>STNELEV</th>
      <th>NAME</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>ACW00011604</td>
      <td>57.7667</td>
      <td>11.8667</td>
      <td>18.0</td>
      <td>SAVE</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>AE000041196</td>
      <td>25.3330</td>
      <td>55.5170</td>
      <td>34.0</td>
      <td>SHARJAH_INTER_AIRP</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>AEM00041184</td>
      <td>25.6170</td>
      <td>55.9330</td>
      <td>31.0</td>
      <td>RAS_AL_KHAIMAH_INTE</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



We will want to use this table to match countries. It turns out the first two characters of the ID match the FIPS 10-4 country code, so let's add that to our table.


```python
stations["FIPS"] = stations["ID"].str[0:2]
```

Now we can add this table directly to the database.


```python
stations.to_sql("stations", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```

### Countries table

Lastly we are going to add our countries table. We can get it from the url below.


```python
countries_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mysociety/gaze/master/data/fips-10-4-to-iso-country-codes.csv"
countries = pd.read_csv(countries_url)
countries.head(3)
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>FIPS 10-4</th>
      <th>ISO 3166</th>
      <th>Name</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>AF</td>
      <td>AF</td>
      <td>Afghanistan</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>AX</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>Akrotiri</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>AL</td>
      <td>AL</td>
      <td>Albania</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



We are going to run into problems with SQL if the column names have spaces, so let's shorten those. It also would be clearer if we changed Name to Country.


```python
countries = countries.rename(columns = {"FIPS 10-4":"FIPS", "ISO 3166":"ISO", "Name":"Country"})
countries.head(3)
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>FIPS</th>
      <th>ISO</th>
      <th>Country</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>AF</td>
      <td>AF</td>
      <td>Afghanistan</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>AX</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>Akrotiri</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>AL</td>
      <td>AL</td>
      <td>Albania</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



Then we can add this table to our database.


```python
countries.to_sql("countries", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```

Since we are done adding to our database, we need to close the connection.


```python
conn.close()
```

## 2 Write a Query Function

Now we are going to write a function that will create a table from the database using SQL

We want to look at temperatures for a given countries and month in a range of years. We want the dataframe to have columns for the station name, latititude, longitude, and country, as well as year, month, and temperature of the reading.   

To get this we will make a command. The command will SELECT all of the columns from the abreviated name of table they came FROM. It will JOIN the temperatures table with station, on id, and countries, on FIPS, in order to do this. In the WHERE statement, we will include the conditions.


```python
def query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month):
    """
    This function creates a dataframe from the climate database of temperatures 
    for stations in a country for a given month and years
    
    Inputs:
    country - the country to look in
    year_begin - the first year to gather data for
    year_end - the last year to gather data for
    month - the number of the month of temperature to look at
    
    Outputs a dataframe according to the specifications
    """
    
    #The command pulls data from all three tables by joining them
    cmd = """
    SELECT S.name, S.latitude, S.longitude, C.country, T.year, T.month, T.temp
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON C.FIPS = S.FIPS
    WHERE C.country= \"""" + str(country) + """\"
    AND T.year >=""" + str(year_begin) + """
    AND T.year <=""" + str(year_end) + """
    AND T.month =""" + str(month)
    
    conn = sqlite3.connect("climate.db") #Open connection
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn) #Execute command
    conn.close() #Close connection
    return df
```

Lets do an example where we look at temperatures in December for stations in Egypt from 2009 to 2012.


```python
query_climate_database("Egypt", 2009, 2012, 12).head()
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>NAME</th>
      <th>LATITUDE</th>
      <th>LONGITUDE</th>
      <th>Country</th>
      <th>Year</th>
      <th>Month</th>
      <th>Temp</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>MERSA_MATRUH</td>
      <td>31.3331</td>
      <td>27.2167</td>
      <td>Egypt</td>
      <td>2009</td>
      <td>12</td>
      <td>16.69</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>MERSA_MATRUH</td>
      <td>31.3331</td>
      <td>27.2167</td>
      <td>Egypt</td>
      <td>2010</td>
      <td>12</td>
      <td>15.90</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>ASSWAN</td>
      <td>23.9667</td>
      <td>32.7831</td>
      <td>Egypt</td>
      <td>2009</td>
      <td>12</td>
      <td>18.90</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>ASSWAN</td>
      <td>23.9667</td>
      <td>32.7831</td>
      <td>Egypt</td>
      <td>2010</td>
      <td>12</td>
      <td>19.50</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>SIWA</td>
      <td>29.2000</td>
      <td>25.3167</td>
      <td>Egypt</td>
      <td>2010</td>
      <td>12</td>
      <td>14.50</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



## 3 Write a Geographic Scatter Function for Yearly Temperature Increases

Our next task is to write a function that will use our query and create a figure to address the following question:

*How does the average yearly change in temperature vary within a given country?*

To do this we are going to group the data by station and estimate the yearly change using linear regression. We will do with with the following function using apply.


```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def coef(data_group):
    """
    This function finds the linear regression equation for a data group
    
    Input: data_group - data group from the groupby function
    
    Outputs the rounded first coefficient of the equation
    """
    x = data_group[["Year"]]
    y = data_group["Temp"]
    LR = LinearRegression()
    LR.fit(x,y)
    return round(LR.coef_[0],3)
```

For labeling we will want to convert numbers to months so let's create a key.


```python
months = {1: "January",
          2: "February",
          3: "March",
          4: "April",
          5: "May",
          6: "June",
          7: "July",
          8: "August",
          9: "September",
          10: "October",
          11: "November",
          12: "December"}
```

We make this figure with plotly.


```python
from plotly import express as px
```

We will create a function that will plot stations in a country to graphically show how temperatures are changing.


```python
def temperature_coefficient_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, month, min_obs, **kwargs):
    """
    This function will create a figure showing the locations of each station in a country, 
    colored by the estimated yearly temperature increase according to the user's specifictions
    
    Inputs:
        country - the country to plot the stations from
        year_begin - the first year to consider
        year_end - the last year to consider
        month - the number of the month whose temperature to look at
        min_obs - the minimum number of observations for a station
        **kwargs - user specified plot arguments
        
    Outputs a map figure with stations as colored dots
    """
    #Use our previous function to gather the data
    df = query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month)
    
    #Get count of observations
    obs = df.groupby(["NAME"])["Month"].transform(np.sum) / month
    
    #Filter out stations with too few observations
    df = df[obs >= min_obs]
    df = df.reset_index()
    
    #Apply coef function from above
    coefs = df.groupby(["NAME", "LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE"]).apply(coef).reset_index()
    coefs = coefs.rename(columns = {0: "Est. Yearly<br>Increase (" + u'\N{DEGREE SIGN}' + "C)"})
    
    title = "Estimates of yearly temperature increase in " + months[month]
    title += "<br>for stations in " + country +", years "+ str(year_begin) + "-" + str(year_end)
    
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(coefs,
                            lat = "LATITUDE",
                            lon = "LONGITUDE",
                            color = "Est. Yearly<br>Increase (" + u'\N{DEGREE SIGN}' + "C)",
                            #0, #This is the coef column
                            color_continuous_midpoint = 0, #Center colorbar
                            hover_name = "NAME",
                            title = title, 
                            mapbox_style = "stamen-terrain",
                            **kwargs)
    return fig
```

Here's an example with Germany.


```python
fig = temperature_coefficient_plot("Germany", 1990, 2020, 8, 
                                   min_obs = 15,
                                   zoom = 4,
                                   color_continuous_scale=px.colors.diverging.RdGy_r)
```

In order to get the plot to appear on our blog, we will save it as an html file.


```python

## 4 Looking at Temperature by Latitude

For this plot we want to answer the question

*How does temperature vary by latitude and does elevation have an impact?*

### Query function

This time we are going to make use of more functions in SQL, where we can actually do all of the preprocessing of the data.

Using a similar process as last time, we are going to select the information about a station and its location from the temperatures table joined with stations and countries. But this time we are going to use a GROUP BY statement to group all the years and months together for each station name. Then in the SELECT statement, we can take the average temperature. We are also renaming the elevation variable here so it clearer. In the WHERE statement, which is before the data is grouped, we exclude some observations with an elevation of 9999, as this data error would mess up our plot. Lastly, we use a HAVING statement, which applies after the GROUP BY, to only include rows with the minimum number of observations.


```python
def query_average_temps(year_begin, year_end, min_obs):
    """
    This function uses the climate database to create a dataframe of 
    average temperatures within the given years for each station, 
    providing it has sufficient observations
    
    Inputs:
    year_begin - the first year to gather data for
    year_end - the last year to gather data for
    min_obs - the minimum number of months of observation the station must have
    
    Outputs a dataframe according to the specifications
    """
        
    cmd = """
    SELECT S.name, C.country, S.latitude, S.longitude,
        S.stnelev as "Elevation (m)", ROUND(AVG(T.temp),2) as Temperature
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON C.FIPS = S.FIPS 
    WHERE T.year >=""" + str(year_begin) + """
    AND T.year <=""" + str(year_end) + """
    AND S.stnelev NOT IN (9999)
    GROUP BY S.name
    HAVING COUNT(T.temp) >= """ + str(min_obs)

    conn = sqlite3.connect("climate.db")
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    conn.close()
    return df
```

Let's look at the table for average temperatures between 2011 and 2019 with a minimum of 20 observations.


```python
query_average_temps(2011, 2019, 20).head()
```




<div>

    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {

    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }

      <td>10.23</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



### Plot function

Now we'll write the function that will make the scatterplot. Since we already preprocessed the dataframe in the SQL query, all we need to do is run that function and make the figure.


```python
def temp_lat_plot(year_begin, year_end, min_obs, **kwargs):
    """
    This function plots the average temperature versus the latitude for
    each station, colored by the elevation.
    
    Inputs:
    year_begin - the first year to gather data for
    year_end - the last year to gather data for
    min_obs - the minimum number of months of observation the station must have
    **kwargs - any additional plotting arguments
    
    Outputs a scatterplot according to the specifications
    """
    #Get data
    df = query_average_temps(year_begin, year_end, min_obs)
    
    title = "Temperature versus latitude and elevation from " + str(year_begin)
    title += " to " + str(year_end)
    
    #Make figure
    fig = px.scatter(df,
                     x = "LATITUDE",
                     y = "Temperature",
                     color = "Elevation (m)",
                     title = title,
                     hover_name = "NAME",
                     hover_data = ["Country"], #Added info
                     **kwargs)
    return fig
```

For an example, lets look at the past 30 years.


```python
fig = temp_lat_plot(1991, 2020, 100,
              color_continuous_scale = "sunset" # Makes high elevation darker
             )
write_html(fig, "plot4.html")
```
{% include plot4.html %}

Here we can see a clear curve, where temperatures are hotter near the equator and cooler as they get closer to the poles. But when we look at temperatures below the curve, those colder than expected, they are mostly at higher altitudes. So we can see that altitude also causes cooler temperatures.

This is especially seen near the South pole in Antarctica, where temperatures get as low as -55 degrees. But all the temperatures below -30 occur above 1900 meters, and if we look at the temperatures at lower elevation but the same altitude, they better match those near the north pole, where there are no stations at high elevation.

## 5 Seasonal Differences by Climate Zone and Hemisphere

The third and final question we want to answer is:

*How do climate zones affect seasonal differences in the northern and southern hemispheres?*

### Query function
To do this we will once again make a query function. This will be similar to the one last time, with the addition of creating new variacles. We will use CASE within the SELECT statement to use latitude to classify the climate zones and hemispheres.


```python
def query_zoning(year_begin, year_end, min_obs):
    """
    This function uses the climate database to create a dataframe of 
    average temperatures within the given years for each month at 
    each station, providing it has sufficient observations, and 
    creates new columns for climate zone and hemisphere
    
    Inputs:
    year_begin - the first year to gather data for
    year_end - the last year to gather data for
    min_obs - the minimum number of months of observation the station must have
    
    Outputs a dataframe according to the specifications
    """
    
    cmd = """
    SELECT S.Name, C.country, S.latitude,
        CASE
            WHEN S.latitude > 60 OR S.latitude < -60 THEN "Polar"
            WHEN S.latitude > 30 OR S.latitude < -30 THEN "Temperate"
            ELSE "Tropical"
            END AS Zone,
        CASE
            WHEN S.latitude > 0 THEN "Northern"
            ELSE "Southern"
            END AS Hemisphere,
       T.month, AVG(T.temp) as Temp
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON C.FIPS = S.FIPS 
    WHERE T.year >=""" + str(year_begin) + """
    AND T.year <=""" + str(year_end) + """
    AND S.stnelev NOT IN (9999)
    GROUP BY S.name, T.month
    HAVING COUNT(T.temp) >= """ + str(min_obs)

    conn = sqlite3.connect("climate.db")
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    conn.close()
    return df
```

Lets look at the resulting dataframe from 1940 to 1950 with 10 observations


```python
query_zoning(1940,1950,10).head()
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">

    <tr style="text-align: right;">

      <th>Zone</th>
      <th>Hemisphere</th>
      <th>Month</th>
      <th>Temp</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>

      <td>50.7839</td>

### Plot function

Next we will make the plot. Here the user will be able to specify the months they want to compare. To allow this, we will use create a separate data frame for each of the two months and then inner join them, so we only have observations with temperatures for both months. Then we can easily find the difference.

We will make a multi faceted violin plot so we can see the distribution of temperatures within each zone.


```python
def zone_violin_plot(year_begin, year_end, min_obs, month1, month2, **kwargs):
    """
    This function makes a violin plot of the difference in average temperature 
    between two specified months. The graph is multi-faceted by hemisphere and
    has separate plots for each climate zone.
    
    Inputs:
    year_begin - the first year to gather data for
    year_end - the last year to gather data for
    min_obs - the minimum number of months of observation the station must have
    month1 - the number of the first month (which will be subtracted from)
    month2 - the number of the second month (which will be subtracted)
    **kwargs - any additional plotting arguments
    
    Outputs a multifaceted violin plot according to the specifications
    """
    #Gather data
    df = query_zoning(year_begin, year_end, min_obs)
    
    #Create dfs for selected months
    m1 = df[df["Month"]==month1]
    m2 = df[df["Month"]==month2]
    
    #Merge and get difference for each station
    df = pd.merge(m1, m2, on = ["NAME", "Country", "Zone","Hemisphere", "LATITUDE"])
    df["Difference"] = df["Temp_x"] - df["Temp_y"]
    
    title = "Temperature difference between " + months[month1] + " and "
    title += months[month2] + "<br>by climate zone and hemisphere"
    
    fig = px.violin(df,
                    x = "Difference",
                    color = "Zone",
                    facet_row = "Hemisphere",
                    title = title,
                    hover_name = "NAME",
                    hover_data = ["Country", "LATITUDE"],
                    category_orders = {"Zone": ["Tropical", "Temperate", "Polar"]},
                    **kwargs)
    return fig
    
```

Now lets use this to look at the difference in average temperatures between July and January over the entirity of our data.


```python
fig = zone_violin_plot(1901, 2020, 12, 7, 1)
write_html(fig, "plot5.html")
```

{% include plot5.html %}

Here we can see that seasonal differences are more pronouced in the temperate zones than in the tropics, as we would expect, and most pronounced in the polar regions, though not by much, particularly in the northern hemisphere. We also see that the differences have opposite signs in the different hemispheres, which is what we would expect as the seasons are opposite. 

We can see that the tropical region starts to have a lot of points near zero, which are likely those stations closest to the equator, but as the tropics extend another 30 degrees of latitude, some of these stations experience seasons more.
